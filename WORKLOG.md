## WORKLOG
0. Investigated project: checked docker setup; checked symfony setup and configurations; checked makefile commands; checked postman collection; checked application domain.
1. Updated .env file to add more MYSQL related variables and use it in DATABASE_URL.
2. Init project using `make init`. (run twice since mysql have some startup delay and first run leads to error)
3. Exec bash of php container and checked symfony by trying `bin/console ca:cl`. Result - OK.
4. Exec /login endpoint in postman and faced typical cache permission issue.
5. Update docker setup to add ACL for `var` directory to fix cache and log permission problems. https://symfony.com/doc/current/setup/file_permissions.html#using-acl-on-a-system-that-supports-setfacl-linux-bsd
6. Investigate tests. Run `make tests` and inspect errors.
7. Fix existing tests.
8. Added PATCH /item/{id} endpoint
9. Covered update endpoint with unit and functional tests. Updated PUT /item endpoint in Postman collection.
10. Make API secure:
	- Updated Nginx container default.config in order to add 433 ssl server and redirect all 80 port income requests to it.
	- Updated Makefile init section: added openssl cert generation step before building docker.
	- Updated nginx docker-compose section to mount ssl certs volume and add 443 port forwarding.
11. Make API fast:
	- Installed symfony profiler package in order to pre-check how fast is API.
	- Tuned Opcache parameters a bit.

12. Refactor:
	- Added exception listener to convert errors to json response (keep BC of response structure).
13. Add more Unit tests.

## NOTES

- SSL implementation is not production ready - To make it production ready I would suggest adding separate container with dnsrobocert in order to autogenerate and renew Letsencrypt certificates.
- Codebase is OK now for small API but can be more refactored and improved in terms of structure. I would suggest implement data transformers layer, separate ItemService to separate use-case classes, add application logging, replace functional tests with behat.
- Speed improvement was done without deep analysis. Better would be create a performance test first and then experiment with opcache and other optimizations.
